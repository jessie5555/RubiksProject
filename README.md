# RubiksProject

This Project was an attempt to create a robot to scramble rubiks cubes and compile them into a coherent image. 

What was done:

- Representation of a rubiks cube
- Image reconstruction

What was not done:
- the algorithm to take a 3x3 matrix of color from the image, and output the moves nescessary to reach the color pattern from a complete rubiks cube

Although this project was not completed, the amount of knowlege I gained from this project was worth the gratification. I spent weeks deepening my knowlege on group theory, quaternion rotation (although not implemented in this version), the A* algorithm, and many other current methods of solving the cube.
